            ===================================================
                    Running The Webby Servlet Container
            ===================================================

Webby Server 1.0 requires a Java Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 8 or later.

=============================
Running With JRE 8 Or Later
=============================

(1) Download and Install a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 8 or later, from
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

(1.2) Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

      You may also use a full Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than just
      a JRE.


(2) Download and Install Webby Server

(2.1) Unpack the binary distribution so that it resides in its own
      directory (conventionally named "webby-server-[version]").

NOTE:  As an alternative to downloading a binary distribution, you can
create your own from the Webby source code.
You can do the full "release" build and find the created distribution in the
"target" directory and then proceed with unpacking as above.


(3) Start Up Webby Server

(3.1) The server can be started by executing the following command:

  On *nix:

      /bin/startup.sh

(3.2) After startup, the web applications will be available by visiting:

      http://localhost:8180/


(4) Shut Down Webby Server

(4.1) The server can be shut down by executing the following command:

  On *nix:

      /bin/shutdown.sh
